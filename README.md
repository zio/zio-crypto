# ZIO Crypto

Fast, secure cryptographic primitives in a ZIO & ZIO Streams friendly package. ZIO Crypto is a ZIO-idiomatic wrapper over Java's basic cryptographic functions. It provides hashing, secure random generation, and HMAC signatures and verifications.

## Project Goals

### Cryptographic Implementations and Dependencies

We wish to have as few dependencies as possible this project. So, when cryptographic primitives are available via Java built-ins, we opt to use them.

However, more than not having dependencies, we do not want to offer implementations of any cryptographic primitives. So, when a new primitive is required and not available via a Java built-in, we use a package. Services using these new packages should be added under new `zio.crypto` Maven packages. 

### NIST-Recommendations and Correctness

We wish to offer the best-practice algorithms according to National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

One common form of error in security is using a non-recommended algorithm with the correct interface. In an effort to keep our library easy-to-use, we try to limit the number of algorithms offered to NIST-recommended algorithms and limit less well-known and less well-used algorithms.

## Installation
